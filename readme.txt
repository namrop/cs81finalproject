To whomever is grading this assignment:

	I just needed to point out that the graphics library on the cs labs
computers were missing the graphwin.checkKey() method, so i copied over a 
different version of the graphics library that had the method, and i renamed
it gv2.py so as to not create any naming conflicts.

Thank You,

Luis E. Ramirez
